# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

# AMMContract Project Explanation

The AMMContract is a simple implementation of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) contract. AMMs are smart contracts designed to provide liquidity for token swapping in decentralized exchanges (DEXs). In this project, the AMMContract facilitates swapping between two ERC20 tokens, tokenA, and tokenB, based on their liquidity pool reserves.

- Key Features of the AMMContract:

* Liquidity Pool: The AMMContract maintains a liquidity pool that holds reserves of tokenA and tokenB. Users can - - add liquidity to this pool by depositing both tokens in a specific ratio.

* Token Swap: The contract allows users to swap tokenA for tokenB and vice versa based on the current reserves in the liquidity pool.

* Token-to-Token Swap: Users can also directly swap one token to another token without involving an external exchange.

* Reserves and Ratios: The contract calculates the number of output tokens based on the current reserves and the desired input amount using a constant-product formula.

* Input Validation: The contract performs various checks, such as ensuring input tokens are different, maintaining liquidity pool ratios, and handling insufficient amounts, to prevent invalid operations.

# Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your machine.
- Ganache (or Ganache CLI) should be installed and running to provide a local development blockchain.
- MetaMask should be installed as a browser extension (e.g., on Google Chrome).
